We present OmniDrive, a novel framework for end-to-end autonomous driving with large language model (LLM) agents. Our main contributions involve novel solutions in both model (OmniDrive-Agent) and benchmark (OmniDrive-nuScenes). The former features a novel 3D vision-language model design, whereas the latter is constituted of comprehensive VQA tasks for reasoning and planning.
